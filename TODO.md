# Possible Expansions for the User Management System

## Password Support (Securely Store and Handle Passwords)
- Add a password field to the User entity (hashed, never plaintext)
- Store hashed passwords using `BCryptPasswordEncoder`
- Ensure passwords are never returned in responses
- Security around password storage & login flow

## Authentication & Authorization (Spring Security or JWT)
- Implement login endpoint (username/email + password)
- Secure endpoints (only authenticated users can access certain routes)
- Role-based access (admin vs regular users)
- Understanding how Spring Security processes JWTs
- Custom claims in JWTs (like user ID, role, etc.)
- Refresh tokens & how to keep users logged in

## User Roles and Permissions
- Add a `role` field (e.g., `ADMIN`, `USER`)
- Restrict certain endpoints to specific roles
- Implement user role updates

## Email Uniqueness Constraint
- Ensure no duplicate emails in the database
- Return proper error message when creating a user with an existing email

## Soft Deletes
- Instead of hard-deleting users, mark them as "deleted"
- Implement a `deletedAt` timestamp
- Filter out soft-deleted users from standard queries

## Profile Management
- Allow users to update their profile information
- Add additional fields (e.g., phone number, profile picture, bio)

## Pagination & Sorting for User Listing
- Implement pagination on `GET /users` to avoid performance issues with large datasets
- Support sorting by different fields (name, email, createdAt)

## Search & Filtering
- Allow searching users by name/email
- Implement dynamic filtering (e.g., ?role=ADMIN&active=true)

## Rate Limiting (Prevent Abuse)
- Limit requests per user/IP (to prevent brute force attacks)
- Implement rate limiting for authentication attempts

## API Documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- Add Swagger UI for interactive API documentation
- Provide example requests and responses

## Unit & Integration Tests
- Write JUnit 5 tests for service and controller layers
- Mock repository/service dependencies for unit testing
- Test validation constraints
- How to test and debug secure endpoints

## Email Notifications
- Send welcome emails when users register
- Notify users when their password changes
- Implement email verification for new accounts

## External Database Support
- Switch from H2 (in-memory) to PostgreSQL or MySQL
- Update `application.properties` to configure the new database

## Deployment & CI/CD
- Set up Docker for easy deployment
- Automate testing and builds with GitHub Actions or Jenkins
- Deploy to a cloud provider (AWS, Heroku, Render)

## Multi-Tenancy (if applicable)
- Support different organizations/tenants using the system
- Implement tenant-based user isolation

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- Allow users to enable 2FA using authenticator apps
- Require 2FA for login if enabled

## Forgot Password / Reset Password Flow
- Implement password reset requests via email
- Generate one-time reset tokens with expiration

## WebSocket Support (for real-time updates)
- Notify users when an admin updates their info
- Live update user lists in a frontend dashboard

## Internationalization (i18n)
- Support multiple languages for error messages and responses
- Load messages dynamically from properties files

## File Uploads (Profile Pictures, Attachments)
- Allow users to upload profile pictures
- Store files in local storage or cloud (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)

## Logging & Monitoring
- Use SLF4J/Logback for structured logging
- Integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, ELK stack)

## Caching (Improve Performance)
- Cache frequently requested user data (Redis, Ehcache)
- Reduce load on the database for common queries

## OAuth2 and Social Login
- OAuth2 and login with Google/GitHub
